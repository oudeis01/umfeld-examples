/**
 * Characters Strings. 
 *  
 * The character datatype, abbreviated as char, stores letters and 
 * symbols in the Unicode format, a coding system developed to support 
 * a variety of world languages. Characters are distinguished from other
 * symbols by putting them between single quotes ('P').
 * 
 * A string is a sequence of characters. A string is noted by surrounding 
 * a group of letters with double quotes ("Processing"). 
 * Chars and strings are most often used with the keyboard methods, 
 * to display text to the screen, and to load images or files.
 * 
 * The String datatype must be capitalized because it is a complex datatype.
 * A String is actually a class with its own methods, some of which are
 * featured below.
